# Amalgamate
Social media aggregating application for iOS

A group project for CMPT 398, our first attempt ever at making an iOS App. This repository got messy. The version we handed in is located in the Develop branch in the Amalgamate2 folder.  We hit many roadblocks trying to develop this app, but we have a version that can put together feeds from twitter and tumblr.  We never reached our goal for this project, but the learning experience was incredible.  Our team faced real world challenges and learned the dangers of depending on third party libraries to always provide the functionality we desired.  We received a great mark on this project because of the process of app developemnt out agile team followed during the development of this app.
